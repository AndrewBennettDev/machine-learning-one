Through an awesome tutorial by Programming with Mosh (check out his YouTube, he's a fantastic teacher!) I'm learning a little about machine learning.
I'm using some free data sets from kaggle.com and just experimenting with some of the basic methods you can use to manipulate data. This will be
WIP for quite some time since I don't have a clear goal. ML is super exciting though, so I'm enjoying the journey!
